<p>When sneaking a look at the fridge, she noticed that there was some <strong><em>milk </em></strong>left and changed her mind about buying a new one. It got crossed out of the list. And, finally, she added a <code class="java">"brownie"</code>, and it became the last item Ruth had put on the list.</p>

<p><em>DON'T</em> print the results.</p>
