<h2>A set and a string</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Write down the command that should be put instead of <code class="language-python">...</code> to get a set of symbols that the set <code class="language-python">a</code> and the string <code class="language-python">b</code> both contain. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = set("my code is brOKen")
b = "i'm not OK with that"
c = ...</code></pre>
<p>Do <em>NOT</em> convert <code class="language-python">b</code> to a set in your solution, it should remain a string.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> What is the difference between set methods and operators? Use the one that works with iterable objects such as strings.</p>
</div>
