<h2>Can’t sort my list!</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Nathan has a list that contains the names of all his friends. He wants to sort it in alphabetical order and then print it. However, when he executes this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_list = ['Mary', 'Bob', 'Pete', 'Jane']
my_list = my_list.sort()
print(my_list)</code></pre>
<p>only <em>None</em> is printed! Help him – find a broken line in his code, fix it and write down the corrected line.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Write only the line that you corrected and not the whole code!</div>
</div>
